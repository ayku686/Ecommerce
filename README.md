# Ecommerce

Hello,
This is an Ecommerce App which shows the catalogue of top products and on selection of a specific product the user navigates to a new screen which shows all the details of that specific product and all the images of that product. All the products and their specific details are fetched through an API>


Below are some of the screenshots of the UI of my Ecommerce app
